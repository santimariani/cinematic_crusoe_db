#Cinematic Crusoe

<b>TECH</b>: FastAPI • PostgreSQL • Postico • Video Implementation

For the next step-up, I used FastAPI to interact with a self-created database, which I made using PostgreSQL. To go the extra mile, I challenged myself to create "blinking eyes" as if one were waking up on a beach after a boat crash... blurry vision and all! Yet, most excitingly, I finally pulled off adding video to a project! And so, The Utterly Curious & Stupendously Miraculous Redemption of One Mister Robinson Crusoe, Not Esquire was gleefully born.
